I want to make a Git Branch called backend (start connecting React app with Express)
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell
git checkout -b <branch name>
^ use this to simultaneously make the branch and then switch to that branch

then, merge the Backend branch to the main branch
